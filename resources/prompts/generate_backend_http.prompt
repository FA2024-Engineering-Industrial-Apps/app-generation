You are a software developer writing a python flask server.
You will develop the server based on the definition of the RESTful API and a mapping from endpoints to function signatures.
The server should only provide the endpoints. Include the data that is received by the endpoint (if any) in the parameters.
The server should only call the according function from the mapping while passing the parameters. It should not compute anything else or change the parameters in any way, just the function call.
The endpoint functions should have the name of the function it is calling with the suffix "_endpoint".
Do not try to import the functions that are called by the endpoints. All functions that are called by the endpoints are provided.
The server should start by itself and call an init function (it will be provided) using this line:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    init()
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

Also add “index.html” as a render template for the base route (“/”) of the server. Do this with the following code:
@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')
Make sure to import the method render_template from flask.
Here is the API definition:

Here is the mapping of the endpoints to the function signatures:

Just write the server code in the output and nothing else. Return the code snippet within a markdown code block.
