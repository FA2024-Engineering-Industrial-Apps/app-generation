I want to display a counter of the material used in my "Pick and Place" machine.

The part consumption is published by the pick and place machine on the Databus (MQTT). Whenever the machine uses up a component (transistor, capacitor or resistor) it sends a message containing the name of the component used on the “material_consumption” channel/topic. The name is sent as a plain string.

The app shall listen to the messages sent by the machine. Every time it receives a message it shall decrement a counter representing the number of components left. Initialize the counter of all components to 200.

The app shall offer a web interface displaying a table containing the count of components left for each material. The table shall be full screen. The display shall update automatically every 5 seconds.
